\chapter{Abstract}
\thispagestyle{empty}
Describe your approach and results shortly in the abstract.
The abstract should really already tell the reader what to expect.
Do not try to  build suspension, this is not a Holywood  movie, it is a
(your!) scientific thesis.  The abstract  is usually the last thing you
write, even if it is the first thing you read here.
